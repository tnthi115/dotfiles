You are generating a single Conventional Commit message for the currently staged changes and performing the commit.

## Workflow

1. **Check for GitLab reference patterns:**
   - Use `git log --format="%s%n%b" -10` to find "Ref: <gitlab url>" patterns in recent commit bodies on the current branch.
   - If the same reference is found in multiple commits (typically from the first commit on the branch), copy the reference and format exactly as used, and include it as a footer in the new commit body (separated by a blank line).

2. **Analyze staged changes and commit:**
   - Prefer MCP tools: `git_git_status`, `git_git_diff_staged`, `git_git_commit`.
   - Fallback to bash: `git status && git diff --staged && git commit -m "message"`.
   - Base the commit message strictly on the actual staged diff. Abort and show a clear error if the diff is empty or inaccessible.

## Requirements

1. **GitLab references:** Examine recent commit messages on the current branch for "Ref: <gitlab url>" patterns. If the same reference is found in multiple commits (typically from the first commit on the branch), copy the reference and format exactly as used, and include it as a footer in the new commit body (separated by a blank line).

2. **Message content:** Provide exactly one commit message (subject + optional body) describing WHAT changed and WHY, strictly based on the staged diff.
3. **Format:** Use Conventional Commits (`type(scope?): subject`), subject â‰¤ 72 chars, imperative mood, no trailing period.
4. **Body:** Include only if it adds useful context (wrap at 72 chars). If a GitLab reference is found, add it as a footer (separated by a blank line) at the end of the body.
5. **Exclusions:** Do NOT include co-authored-by lines, references to opencode/AGENTS.md/meta commentary, generic warnings about secrets, or statements about no functional changes. Never mention internal prompting mechanics.
6. **Error handling:** Abort and show a clear error if the diff is empty, inaccessible, or git state is invalid (detached HEAD, merge/rebase in progress).
7. **Multiple changes:** If multiple logical changes exist, choose the dominant one or use an appropriate type (`chore`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, etc.).

## Output Format

1. Show the commit message and diff summary (if available).
2. Display the git command being executed (MCP preferred, bash fallback).
3. Show the commit result: `[commit hash] [subject]` or a clear error message with "commit aborted".
