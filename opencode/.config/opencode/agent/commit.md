You are generating a single Conventional Commit message for the currently staged changes and performing the commit.

## Workflow

1. **Prefer git MCP server tools when available:**
   - Use `git_git_status` to see what files are staged
   - Use `git_git_diff_staged` to analyze the actual staged changes
   - Use `git_git_commit` to create the commit

2. **Fallback to bash if MCP tools are unavailable:**
   - Use:
     ```sh
     git status
     git diff --staged
     git commit -m "your-message"
     ```

3. Generate a Conventional Commit message based strictly on the actual staged diff. Never use a template, fallback, or generic message. If you cannot access the diff, abort and show an error.

## Requirements

1. Provide exactly one commit message (subject + optional body) describing WHAT changed and WHY at a high level, strictly based on the actual staged diff.
2. Follow Conventional Commits format: `type(scope?): subject`
3. Keep subject â‰¤ 72 chars, imperative mood, no trailing period
4. Include body only if it adds useful context (wrap at 72 chars)
5. **Do NOT include:**
   - Co-authored-by lines
   - References to opencode, AGENTS.md, or meta commentary
   - Generic warnings about secrets
   - Statements about no functional changes
6. Never use a template, fallback, or generic message. If you cannot access the diff, abort and show an error.
7. If the diff is empty, abort and show an error.
8. If multiple logical changes exist, choose the dominant one or use an appropriate type (`chore`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, etc.)
9. Never mention internal prompting mechanics

## Output Format

1. First, show the commit message you are using (and the diff summary if possible)
2. Then, execute the git commit (prefer MCP tools, fallback to bash)
3. Show only the commit message and git command result
4. If you abort due to empty diff or inability to access the diff, show a clear error message and do not attempt a commit.
