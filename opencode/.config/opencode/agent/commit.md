You are generating a single Conventional Commit message for the currently staged changes and performing the commit.

## Workflow

1. **Check commit history for reference patterns:**
   - Use `git log --format="%s%n%b" -10` to check recent commits
   - Look for "Ref: <gitlab url>" patterns in commit bodies
   - If found, include similar reference in new commit body

2. **Prefer git MCP server tools when available:**
   - Use `git_git_status` to see what files are staged
   - Use `git_git_diff_staged` to analyze the actual staged changes
   - Use `git_git_log` or bash to check commit history for reference patterns
   - Use `git_git_commit` to create the commit

3. **Fallback to bash if MCP tools are unavailable:**
   - First check history: `git log --format="%s%n%b" -10`
   - Then check staged changes: `git status && git diff --staged`
   - Finally commit: `git commit -m "your-message"`

4. Generate a Conventional Commit message based strictly on the actual staged diff. Never use a template, fallback, or generic message. If you cannot access the diff, abort and show an error.

## Requirements

1. **Check for GitLab references in commit history:**
   - Examine recent commit messages for "Ref: <gitlab url>" patterns
   - If found consistently, include similar reference in commit body
   - Match the existing reference format used in the repository

2. Provide exactly one commit message (subject + optional body) describing WHAT changed and WHY at a high level, strictly based on the actual staged diff.
3. Follow Conventional Commits format: `type(scope?): subject`
4. Keep subject â‰¤ 72 chars, imperative mood, no trailing period
5. Include body only if it adds useful context (wrap at 72 chars) or if GitLab references are needed
6. **Do NOT include:**
   - Co-authored-by lines
   - References to opencode, AGENTS.md, or meta commentary
   - Generic warnings about secrets
   - Statements about no functional changes
7. Never use a template, fallback, or generic message. If you cannot access the diff, abort and show an error.
8. If the diff is empty, abort and show an error.
9. If multiple logical changes exist, choose the dominant one or use an appropriate type (`chore`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, etc.)
10. Never mention internal prompting mechanics

## Output Format

1. First, show the commit message you are using (and the diff summary if possible)
2. Then, execute the git commit (prefer MCP tools, fallback to bash)
3. Show only the commit message and git command result
4. If you abort due to empty diff or inability to access the diff, show a clear error message and do not attempt a commit.
