# Personal OpenCode Agent Configuration

## Always Ask For Confirmation

When modifying code:

1. First show the proposed changes
2. Ask for explicit confirmation before executing any code changes
3. Only proceed with file modifications after receiving clear approval

## Confirmation and Safety

- Always show proposed changes before modifying any files
- Ask for explicit confirmation before executing code changes
- Only proceed after receiving clear approval
- When making multiple related changes, group them together and ask for a single confirmation

## Code Style Preferences

- Use consistent spacing (2 spaces for indentation)
- Follow existing code style in files being modified
- Keep functions focused and small when possible
- Add descriptive variable names
- Maintain proper error handling

## Workflow Preferences

- Explain your reasoning before suggesting solutions
- When debugging, trace through the code's execution path
- For complex tasks, outline your approach first
- Show alternatives for non-trivial decisions

## Security Practices

- Never commit sensitive data or credentials
- Alert me about potential security issues in code
- Sanitize user inputs in web applications
- Use environment variables for configuration
